I think that's missing some of the robustification in stop and join

Miikka
yeah, probably
can't remember what, though
O
opqdonut (IRC)
and there were timeouting versions of stop and join
in addition to the "hard" ones
and there was optional error handling, :finally and :catch, I think
and :on-stop
(for the cases where you want to communicate stopping with something else than interrupt)
and .checkErrors or something like that
and right! .stop and .join rethrew errors from the thread
O
so you didn't lose them
